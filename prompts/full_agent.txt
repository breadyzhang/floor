GOOGLE SLIDES: AUTO-BUILD IMAGE DECK (WITH OPTIONAL PRESET LIST)

GOAL
Create a Google Slides deck where each slide shows exactly one image representing an example of {TOPIC}. If {ITEM-LIST} is provided, create one slide per item in that list (in order). If {ITEM-LIST} is not provided, create 20 slides using diverse, representative examples of {TOPIC}. For each slide, write the correct answer (the example’s canonical name) in that slide’s Speaker Notes.

CONSTRAINTS
- TEMPLATE/LAYOUT: NEVER change the template. ALWAYS ensure each slide’s layout is **Blank**.
- Layout: No titles or text boxes on the slide itself.
- Placement: After inserting an image, do NOT resize, move, crop, or format it—accept Google Slides’ default placement.
- Content: Exactly one image per slide. No extra elements (no captions, shapes, borders, or backgrounds).
- Image Source: Use the right-hand **Stock & Web** sidebar (right toolbar, **4th icon from the top**). In that sidebar, select the **Google Images** section (NOT “Stock images”).
- Speaker Notes are allowed and required; slides themselves must remain text-free.

INPUTS
- {TOPIC} (required): The category, e.g., “major US city”, “US national park”, “car brand”.
- {ITEM-LIST} (optional): A newline- or comma-separated list of canonical item names for {TOPIC}. If present, use these items exactly as provided and in order.

SLIDE COUNT
- If {ITEM-LIST} is provided: SLIDES = number of items in {ITEM-LIST}.
- Else: SLIDES = 20.

PROCESS
1) Open (or create) the target Google Slides deck.
2) Confirm the current slide layout is **Blank**. If clicking “+” doesn’t produce a Blank slide, set **Blank** once, then proceed.
3) Build the working item set:
   - If {ITEM-LIST} provided: split into items (trim whitespace); this is the exact ordered list.
   - Else: generate a list of 20 diverse, representative examples of {TOPIC} (avoid near-duplicates).
4) For each item in the working list:
   a. Click the “+” (top-left) to insert a new **Blank** slide.
   b. Open the **Stock & Web** sidebar (right toolbar, 4th icon from top). In the sidebar, click **Google Images** (NOT “Stock images”).
   c. Search using the item’s name; if ambiguous, append {TOPIC} (e.g., “{ITEM} {TOPIC}”).
   d. Click exactly one suitable, high-quality image (prefer landscape). Insert it.
   e. Do NOT adjust the image after insertion.
   f. Add **Speaker Notes** for this slide: `Answer: <ITEM>` (use the canonical item name).
5) If no suitable image appears:
   - Try a closely related term (e.g., a prominent landmark or synonym tied to the same item).
   - If still unavailable: choose a different, distinct example of {TOPIC}; set Speaker Notes to that chosen example’s canonical name.

COMPLETION CHECK
- Slide count equals:
  - `len({ITEM-LIST})` when provided; OR
  - `20` when {ITEM-LIST} is omitted.
- Every slide uses the **Blank** layout (template unchanged).
- Exactly one image is inserted on each slide.
- No titles, shapes, captions, or other elements on slides.
- No image was resized, moved, cropped, or formatted after insertion.
- **Speaker Notes** exist on every slide with `Answer: <ITEM>`.
- Images are diverse and clearly represent their items/{TOPIC}.

REQUIRED FIELDS TO EDIT BEFORE RUNNING
- {TOPIC} = __________________________________
- {ITEM-LIST} (optional; paste list here, newline or comma separated) =
__________________________________________________
